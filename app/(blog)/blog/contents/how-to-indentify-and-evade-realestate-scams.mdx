Be wary of scammers who rush you into decisions. They may say things like, “This deal won’t last long!” Don’t fall for these urgent pressure tactics. 
Take your time. A good decision today is far better than a rushed decision tomorrow.

## Avoiding Cash Transactions

Another vital tip: avoid cash transactions whenever possible. Using cash makes it hard to prove what happened if something goes wrong. Instead, opt for secure methods like bank transfers or cheques. This way, you’ll have a record of your payment.


## Conducting Site Visits
