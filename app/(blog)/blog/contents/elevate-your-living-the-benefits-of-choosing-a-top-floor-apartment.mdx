If you’re living in a rental apartment and wondering which floor to choose, you’re not alone. I’ve been there, and I currently live on the sixth floor of an eight-story building. 
When I moved in, I noticed that the seventh and eighth floors were fully occupied. At first, I didn’t know why, but now I understand the many benefits of living on the top floors.

## Appeal of Top Floors

One of the biggest reasons to consider living on the top floors is the excellent views. From up there, you can see everything happening around you. 
Imagine watching the sunset or spotting birds and airplanes in the sky. It’s an appealing experience that adds joy to your daily life.

## Peaceful Environment

Another great advantage is the peaceful environment you get on the higher floors. There’s a lot less noise compared to the ground floor or middle floors. 
Kids playing and other tenants can create a lot of sound. On the top floors, you can relax and enjoy your space without disturbances. 
It’s perfect for focusing on your hobbies or just unwinding after a long day.

## Enhanced Safety and Security

Safety is essential for every tenant. Living on the top floor often means better stability and tight security. 
Many buildings have CCTV cameras that monitor the entire area. If something happens, those living on the ground and middle floors are usually the first to be affected. 
Being higher up gives you an extra layer of protection.

## Comfort and Ambience

Living on the top floors also means you get great air condition and natural light. I remember living on the ground floor, and it felt damp and dark. 
Higher floors let in more sunlight, which creates a bright and welcoming atmosphere. Good air circulation improves your overall quality of life, making your home feel fresh and comfortable.

## Pest Control Advantages

One of the most annoying things about living on lower floors is the risk of pests. They tend to come from the ground and middle floors. 
If you choose the top floor, you’ll find it much easier to avoid those unwanted guests. It’s a huge relief not having to worry about bugs and pests invading your space.

## Cleanliness and Maintenance

The cleanliness of top floors is usually better. Since they are less prone to drainage issues, there are fewer bad odors and blockages. 
A clean environment is crucial for your comfort and enjoyment. You want to come home to a place that feels fresh and inviting.

## Lifestyle Benefits

Living on the top floors gives you easy access to rooftops and clothes lines. You can enjoy the rooftop for relaxing or hosting gatherings with friends. 
It’s a fantastic place for a birthday party or just to unwind on a sunny day. Plus, hanging clothes on a clothesline becomes a breeze when you live higher up.
It’s highly recommended to consider the top-floor lifestyle when choosing a rental apartment. 
You’ll enjoy excellent views, a peaceful environment, and added safety. These benefits can greatly improve your living experience. 
So, if you’re thinking about moving, take a look at those upper floors. You won’t regret it.
