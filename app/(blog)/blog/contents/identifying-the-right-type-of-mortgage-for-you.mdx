When purchasing a home, you may not have enough funds to cover the entire price. The amount you pay is a down payment.  To finance the remaining expenses of buying the house, you may need help from a lender. A mortgage is the money borrowed from a lender to assist in financing your home purchase. It is in fact a legal contract between you and your lender.
It is essential to understand the different types of mortgages available, including the terms and conditions of each. However, it can be hard to know which option is best for you. 

The key to making a well-informed decision is knowing which one is suitable for your needs. In this article, we will examine the most common types of mortgages in Kenya 

## Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs)

An adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) is a type of mortgage that offers a lower initial interest rate that can change periodically based on market conditions. The interest rate is tied to a market index, such as the Central Bank Rate. 
Theyâ€™re a suitable option for borrowers who expect their income to increase in the future or who can afford possible rate increases.
However, the main risk with ARMs is that if interest rates go up, your payments rise.

## Fixed-Rate Mortgages

A fixed-rate mortgage is a type of mortgage where the interest rate remains the same for the entire term of the loan. Typically ranging from 15 to 30 years. This means your monthly payments will stay the same. 
It is a suitable option for individuals who prefer consistency in their payments and those who plan to stay in their home for a long period. If you are expecting interest rates to rise in the near future, it is the best choice. 
However, the interest rates are usually higher than those for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs).

## Interest-only mortgage

Here you only pay the interest on the loan for a set period of time. Usually 5-10 years. After the set period of time, you begin paying both principal and interest. The principal is typically the original loan amount that you borrow from a lender to purchase a home. 
It is a suitable option for borrowers who expect to have a higher income in the future.

## Offset mortgage

An offset mortgage is a type of mortgage that involves balancing your savings and your current account against your mortgage amount. It can assist in lowering the total interest paid throughout the loan term and in speeding up mortgage repayment.
It is a suitable option for people with a lot of savings or those who frequently get large amounts of money, like bonuses, and want to reduce the amount of interest they have to pay.

## Reducing Balance Mortgages

A Reducing Balance Mortgage is a type of mortgage where the interest is calculated on the remaining principal balance, rather than on the original loan amount. It is often preferred by those who want to minimize long-term borrowing costs.
 It's a suitable option for those who want to pay off their mortgage faster and build equity more quickly.

Additionally, when applying for a mortgage, try to clear the small and short-term debts. This will demonstrate that you manage your funds responsibly and that you are fit for a long term mortgage commitment. 

In conclusion, taking the time to assess your needs, consulting professionals and understanding the pros and cons of each option allows you to choose a financing solution that best fits your financial situation and long-term goals.
